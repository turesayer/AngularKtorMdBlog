# Hello World

Welcome to True to Ture: Side-Project Stories, my new blog where I’ll share my
side projects. I'm Ture and my day job involves building enterprise web 
applications, which means I can’t experiment with many of the technologies I 
love. Outside of work, I enjoy creating all kinds of apps—web, mobile, desktop,
CLI, you name it.

Here are a few examples of what I’ve worked on in the past year:
+ A minimal smart-home system to control our coffee machine and lights (Shelly 
  devices, a Spring Boot backend, and an Android app)
+ A self-built home server running Nextcloud, a Git server, a Markdown wiki, 
  and other services
+ A personal link shortener on my own domain, complete with a Flutter-based 
  Chrome extension

Because I’ve been deploying everything on a private home server and storing 
code on my own Git server, very few people have seen these projects. Although
none of them are earth-shaking, I’ve learned a lot along the way—and I think
those lessons could help others. Maybe you’ll even find a project you want to 
use or contribute to.

Here’s my plan:
+ Audit each side project (e.g., removing any accidentally committed secrets)
+ Write up a clear, concise overview of the projects and my learnings and
  publish it on this very blog
+ Publish the code on GitHub or another public Git host to provide you with the
  opportunity to read the full code, check it out yourself or even provide some
  contribution

My first post will be about this very blog engine, which I wrote last weekend 
after deciding I needed a platform to share everything. Why build my own engine
when there are hundreds out there? Simply put: because I can. I wanted to 
experiment with new libraries, learn something new—and now you’re here to 
follow along.

Let’s dive in!
